KISS -  Keeping it simple's strenuous. That's why we did it for you. We've packed a V8 under the hood of this lightweight chore tracking app, so your apt goes from zero to spiffy in n occupants. :P
A user will create an account and a unit in one fell swoop. In the introductory version we've begun with an open floor plan, allowing everyone in a unit to add and adjust chores.
Subsequent users will sign up and have the option to create a unit or choose from the existing selection. Their request to join a unit will be pending until any of its current members approve it in the unit show page. They will then appear in the lightning view where all occupants can see a card for each person in the house with the status of their respective tasks.

Design - We encountered major decisions around the shape of login and authorization. Whether a master user would create members in an account and distribute access, or people sign in and then address accounts had large implications on the organization of the backend. With a platform lending itself to auth across the board, we determined that which surrounds an admin to be less crucial in the initial UX.
